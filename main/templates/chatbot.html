                                            <br><br>
                                            <strong>Reason:</strong> Bacterial pneumonia is caused by bacteria that infect the lungs. The most common bacterial pathogens include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. These bacteria enter the lungs through inhalation of droplets, often after a respiratory infection like the flu or cold, or through direct aspiration of infected material from the mouth or throat.
                                            <br><br>
                                            <strong>Description:</strong> Bacterial pneumonia leads to inflammation of the lung tissue, resulting in the filling of alveoli (air sacs in the lungs) with pus, fluid, and bacteria. This impairs the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, leading to breathing difficulties. Symptoms include:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>High fever</li>
                                                <li>Severe cough (often with green or yellow mucus)</li>
                                                <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                                                <li>Chest pain</li>
                                                <li>Fatigue</li>
                                                <li>Rapid breathing and increased heart rate</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            In severe cases, it can cause sepsis or respiratory failure.

                                                <li><b>Hygiene:</b> Wash hands frequently and cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing to prevent transmission.</li>
                                                <li><b>Avoid smoking:</b> Smoking damages lung tissues and weakens the immune response.</li>
                                                <li><b>Ventilation:</b> Good indoor ventilation can reduce bacterial buildup.</li>

                                            <strong>Reason:</strong> COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is primarily spread through respiratory droplets and aerosols from an infected person. It can also spread via surfaces that are contaminated by the virus. The virus affects the respiratory system and can lead to widespread inflammation in the body.

                                            <strong>Description:</strong> COVID-19 symptoms vary from mild to severe. It primarily affects the lungs, causing pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but it can also affect other organs. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus and include:

                                                <li>Sore throat</li>

                                            Severe cases may require mechanical ventilation or intensive care, particularly in older adults and those with underlying health conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or lung disease.

                                            <br><br>
                                            <strong>Reason:</strong> Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which primarily affects the lungs but can also spread to other parts of the body, including the kidneys, bones, and brain. TB spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, releasing bacteria into the environment.
                                            <br><br>
                                            <strong>Description:</strong> TB infection can be latent (where the person carries the bacteria but doesn't show symptoms) or active (where the bacteria multiply and cause illness). Active TB causes symptoms such as:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Persistent cough (often lasting more than 3 weeks)</li>

                                            </ul>
                                            Without treatment, TB can be fatal, especially if the infection spreads to other organs.

                                            <strong>Reason:</strong> Viral pneumonia is caused by various viruses, including the influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, and coronaviruses. These viruses invade the lung tissues and cause inflammation in the air sacs (alveoli), resulting in impaired oxygen exchange.

                                            RSV pneumonia is particularly common in young children and the elderly. It can cause wheezing and severe difficulty breathing.

                                            <br><br>
                                            TB is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which primarily affects the lungs but can spread to other organs. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.
                                            <br><br>
                                            <strong>Symptoms:</strong> Chronic cough lasting over 3 weeks, coughing up blood, chest pain, weight loss, fever, night sweats, and fatigue. TB can also cause severe complications if untreated.

                                            Viral pneumonia is caused by several viruses, such as the influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or coronaviruses. The infection leads to inflammation in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe.
                                            <br><br>
                                            <strong>Symptoms:</strong> Mild symptoms like fever, cough (often dry), fatigue, and shortness of breath. In some cases, chest pain and wheezing can also occur. RSV is particularly concerning for young children and the elderly.

                                                <li><b>Supportive Treatment:</b> For most viral pneumonia cases, supportive care is sufficient, including hydration, rest, and pain relievers.</li>
                                                <li><b>Antiviral Medications:</b> In cases of influenza or RSV, antiviral drugs like oseltamivir (Tamiflu) may be prescribed to reduce symptoms and duration.</li>
